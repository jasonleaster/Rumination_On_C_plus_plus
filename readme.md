### Practices on "<< Ruminations On C++ >>"

In this repository, I shared my practice code in that great book << Ruminations on C++ >>.

I wish you will talk with me if you meet trouble in reading this book.

Are find some little error which is about press in that book?

I did :) and wish you will be OK when you meet that trouble.

If you find something wrong with my code, 
You could touch me by e-mail: jasonleaster@gmail.com

Thank you~
